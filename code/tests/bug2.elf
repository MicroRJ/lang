// STATUS: [FIXED]
// Solution:
// It was a simple facepalm moment bug, I was
// iterating over the GC array whilst removing
// items from it by swapping the current item
// with the last one but I forgot to decrement
// the index so that it wouldn't skip item that
// I swapped with.
// Bug:
// The GC fails to actually collect anything,
// it marks everything properly and it tells
// you so, but it doesn't actually collect
// the unmarked objects.
// here are some logs:
// here marked means the number of objects that went
// from specifically from white to black.
// (tbf) = to be freed
// / = the total number of objects
// (->) what it should go down to
// DEBUG lgc.c[142] elf_collect(): tbf: 426/512 -> 86
// DEBUG lgc.c[168] elf_collect():         => leaked: 213, 1, 0
// DEBUG lgc.c[142] elf_collect(): tbf: 938/1024 -> 86
// DEBUG lgc.c[168] elf_collect():         => leaked: 469, 1, 0
// DEBUG lgc.c[142] elf_collect(): tbf: 1962/2048 -> 86
