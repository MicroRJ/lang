// STATUS [FIXED]:
// GC would trigger when a new object
// was created, however, I was careless
// and I was modifying the value of
// where the object resided before the
// object was created, making the gc
// think that the object was a different
// type.
// ; locals[b.x].tag = TAG_TAB;
// ; locals[b.x].t   = elf_newtab(R);
// So when the gc would check local at b.x
// it would think that it was a table, when
// it wasn't.
// The fix is just to create the object,
// then modify the value.
